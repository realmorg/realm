## Realm Framework Announcement: Transition and Recommendations

First and foremost, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has contributed to Realm Framework over the years. Open Source is challenging work, and many of the larger features and refactoring efforts would never have been possible without your support!

As I write this in 2025, Realm Framework as a project has entered **"maintenance mode"**. This decision has been made due to several key factors:

1. **Instability in the Shadow DOM and Web Component API**: The browser implementations of the Shadow DOM and the Web Component API, which are core to the Realm Framework‚Äôs functionality, have seen frequent changes and instability. These shifts have introduced breaking changes that impact the framework‚Äôs core features, making it increasingly difficult to maintain compatibility.

2. **Ecosystem Shifts**: The web development ecosystem has evolved rapidly, with alternative solutions gaining significant traction. Libraries like [Shoelace](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace), which provide professionally designed, standards-based web components, have emerged as strong contenders. These alternatives offer robust support for modern web standards and are seeing widespread adoption.

3. **Diminished Active Usage**: As the primary maintainer (myself, a.k.a. the "core maintainer of Realm Framework since ~2017"), I no longer have active deployments of Realm in large-scale production applications. Without real-world usage to guide development, maintaining the framework becomes increasingly difficult and less impactful.

### Commitment to Stability

While the project is in maintenance mode, it will not undergo drastic API changes or introduce breaking shifts. One of our guiding principles has always been to minimize migration burdens for developers. Realm Framework will remain available, with occasional bug fixes and minor improvements, to support the existing user base.

### Recommendations for New Projects

For new projects, I **do not recommend adopting Realm Framework**. The underlying instability of the Shadow DOM and Web Component API, combined with ecosystem shifts, makes it challenging to guarantee long-term stability and support.

Instead, I encourage developers to explore [Shoelace](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace), a forward-thinking library of web components that:

- Works with all frameworks üß©
- Is fully customizable with CSS üé®
- Includes an official dark theme üåõ
- Prioritizes accessibility ‚ôøÔ∏è
- Is built on modern web standards and actively maintained.

Shoelace provides a stable, standards-based alternative that aligns with current industry trends and ensures compatibility with future web technologies.

### Donations and Funding

Given the shift to maintenance mode, I no longer feel comfortable accepting donations for Realm Framework. As of today, all existing subscription tiers have been removed, and any recurring donations have been canceled. A small reserve remains to fund ongoing maintenance efforts, and bug bounties may be issued occasionally for critical issues.

### Thank You!

Thank you for your understanding and continued support throughout the years. It has been an incredible journey, and I‚Äôm grateful for the contributions and trust from the community.

Happy coding and best wishes for your projects,  
**The Realm Framework Team**
