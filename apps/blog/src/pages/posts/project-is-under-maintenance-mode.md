## Realm Framework Update: Transition to Maintenance and Future Guidance

Thank you to everyone who has shown interest in Realm Framework over the years. While community involvement has been limited, the project has benefited greatly from the feedback, and encouragement. That said, the bulk of the development, maintenance, and decision-making has been carried out solely by myself since its inception.

As of 2025, Realm Framework has officially transitioned into **"maintenance mode."** This decision is based on several key developments:

1. **Unstable Foundations in Web Standards**  
   The core technologies that Realm depends on‚Äînamely the Shadow DOM and Web Component APIs‚Äîhave undergone frequent and unpredictable changes across browsers. These shifts have made maintaining stable, cross-browser behavior extremely difficult and time-consuming for a solo maintainer.

2. **The Shifting Ecosystem**  
   The web development landscape has evolved significantly. Libraries like [Shoelace](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace), which deliver well-designed, standard-compliant components, have emerged as leading alternatives. Their active communities and robust toolsets offer a more sustainable future for modern projects.

3. **Lack of Real-World Usage**  
   Since Realm Framework is no longer being used in any of my active production applications, and with no other contributors involved, it has become impractical to continue innovating or expanding its features. The absence of field usage removes the real-world feedback that is vital for iterative improvement.

### What "Maintenance Mode" Means

No breaking changes or major new features will be introduced going forward. My goal is to preserve stability and reduce disruption for existing users. While the project will stay online and usable, only occasional bug fixes and small updates will be made when necessary.

### If You're Starting a New Project

If you're starting fresh, **Realm Framework is not recommended**. The combination of evolving platform standards, lack of contributor involvement, and an outdated foundation makes Realm a less reliable choice for future-proof development.

Instead, I suggest exploring [Shoelace](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace), which provides:

- Compatibility with any frontend framework üß©
- Complete theming and customization via CSS üé®
- An official dark mode üåõ
- A strong emphasis on accessibility ‚ôøÔ∏è
- A modern, actively maintained codebase

Shoelace is better aligned with current web standards and enjoys consistent community and developer support.

### Ending Donations and Support Funding

Since the project has always been a one-person effort, and with development now slowed to essential upkeep only, continuing to accept donations no longer feels appropriate. All recurring contributions have been canceled, and no new donations will be accepted. A small reserve remains for critical patches or occasional bug bounties.

### In Gratitude

Although this has been a mostly solo project, I'm deeply thankful for those who used, shared, or supported Realm Framework in any way. It has been an insightful and rewarding journey.

Wishing you great success in your development journey,  
**Realm Framework (Maintained by a solo developer)**
